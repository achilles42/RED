# RED
RED (stands for Request, Error and Duration) is a golang middleware library, exposes requests, error rate and duration of HTTP requests out of the box.

From the Four Golden signals to the RED way of creating Metrics. The RED method is a subset of “The Four Golden Signals” that’s focused on micro-service architectures and which includes these metrics:

**Rate**: the number of requests our service is serving per second;

**Error**: the number of failed requests per second;

**Duration**: the amount of time it takes to process a request;

Measuring these metrics is pretty straightforward, especially with tools like Prometheus, and using the same metrics for every service helps us create a standard and easy-to-read format for dashboards that have to show the results.
